# Numeratore — handoff notes

This folder (`F:\numeratore`, repo `ispbillingai/numeratore`, **public**) is a copy of `F:\pub`
(repo `ispbillingai/pub`, the Focacciami POS), copied on 2026-10-06 at commit `3436519`
("Loyalty: coupon rules by spend, plus a \"single purchase\" period"). Work on **numeratore** continues here.
It is a separate app: changes made here do not reach pub/Focacciami, and pub changes do not reach this repo.
The sister copy made the same day is `F:\chiamata` (`ispbillingai/chiamata`).

## What the app is (inherited from pub)
PHP + MariaDB restaurant POS: admin, cashier, waiter, kitchen, guest ordering (QR menu),
fiscal printing, card payments (Epson RT protocol 17 / Dojo), Glovo orders, "Clienti online"
(`online.php`). The numeratore-specific features are built on top of this.

## Where it runs
- Server: the same machine as pub, 217.160.131.242 (IONOS Ubuntu 24.04, Apache 2.4, PHP 8.3,
  MariaDB 10.11), SSH as root. Credentials and the plink one-liner are in Claude's local memory
  `pub-server.md` (`C:\Users\magom\.claude\projects\f--numeratore\memory\`), never in git.
- App folder: `/var/www/html/numeratore` (git clone of `ispbillingai/numeratore`, branch `main`).
- Domain: https://numeratore.upgradesrls.com (DNS A → 217.160.131.242 since 2026-10-06). Vhosts
  `/etc/apache2/sites-available/numeratore.conf` (:80, redirects to https) and `numeratore-le-ssl.conf`
  (:443, Let's Encrypt via certbot, auto-renew). Server timezone in `config/database.php`: Europe/Rome.
- DB: `numeratore`, user `numeratore` (password only in the server's `config/database.php`). Seeded from the
  pub DB on 2026-10-06 (menu, rooms, tables, staff users, workspaces). Orders, customers,
  WhatsApp/TextMeBot, Glovo, payment-gateway, Cashmatic and printer settings were removed.
- Logs: `/var/log/apache2/numeratore.upgradesrls.com-error.log` (and `-access.log`).
- `config/devices.php` on the server is the example file with every device **disabled**, so this app
  never touches the shop printer, POS or Cashmatic that pub uses. Enable devices only when asked.

## Workflow (do this after EVERY change, without being asked)
1. Edit locally in `F:\numeratore`, `git commit`, `git push origin main`.
2. On the server, via plink:
   `cd /var/www/html/numeratore && git pull origin main && php migrate.php`
3. Wait ~3 s (opcache revalidate_freq=2), then test live:
   - `php -l` each changed PHP file on the server;
   - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://numeratore.upgradesrls.com/login.php`;
   - render changed pages with a CLI script that sets `$_SESSION['user_id']`;
   - `tail /var/log/apache2/numeratore.upgradesrls.com-error.log`: no new errors.
4. Report the commit hash and the test result.

## Rules
- Deploy this repo **only** to `/var/www/html/numeratore`. Never pull it into `/var/www/html/pub`
  (Focacciami, live), `/var/www/html/chiamata` (the sister copy) or ristorante.
- Never hand-edit tracked files on the server. `config/database.php` and `config/devices.php` are
  gitignored and server-only.
- The repo is public: never commit passwords, API keys or tokens.
- New tables need `COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci`.
- Users are never deleted, only disabled or enabled.
- Never change the WireGuard tunnel on this server (pub uses it to reach the shop's printer).
- Local setup: copy `config/database.example.php` to `config/database.php` (and `devices.example.php`),
  import `database_schema.sql`, then run `php migrate.php`.
- Older project notes (from pub/order) are in [docs/claude-memory/](docs/claude-memory/).
